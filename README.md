# streamline

###A design prototype for the (non-existent) streaming video aggregator service, *streamline*

**[View the demo](http://www.annakaringal.com/demos/streamline)**

*streamline* allows users to not only get detailed information and reviews on a movie or a TV show, and which streaming services it’s on, but also information about their accounts on the streaming services they're member's of. Streamline will tell you if you’ve already streamed, rented or purchased a movie or show, what you rated it on, say, Netflix or Amazon, and whether or not you’ve put it you’ve put it on your iTunes wishlist or Hulu queue.

##To Do: 

* Sign in checks user db record and authenticates
* Register checks if user email already exists and throws error
